# Journey through DeepLearning.AI's LLM Application Development Course

I'd like to share my journey through DeepLearning.AI's Course in LangChain for LLM Application Development.

In this repository, you'll find various notebooks that I have go over and ran as part of this course, located in the `src/` directory. While traveling through the course, I used these notebooks to learn, practice, and internalize the concepts about LangChain and LLM.

To navigate these resources, you would need to update the `.env file` with your `openai key`. A `data` folder is included in the repository that houses relevant data sources you might need to explore.

## Highlights:

I learned and gain hands-on experience in:

1. **Models, Prompts, and Parsers**: The ideas around these elements crystallized for me how to interact with LLMs, create prompts, and parse results into a usable form.

2. **Memories for LLMs**: This fascinating topic taught me how to design memories aptly for storing conversations and managing the context within them.

3. **Chains**: Dealing with chains was extraordinarily enriching. I learned first hand how crucial every operation sequence is when it comes to planning and executing in LLMs.

4. **Question Answering over Documents**: This practice-oriented section had me applying my learnings to my proprietary datasets, ingeniously molding LLMs to fit my unique use cases.

5. **Agents**: Discovering the capacity of LLMs as reasoning agents was the high point for me. The potential held within solidified my belief in the possibilities of LLMs evolution.

At the conclusion of the course, I was left with a holistic, deep understanding of diffusion models that could be used as foundational blocks for all my future applications.

Conducted by LangChain creator Harrison Chase and mentored by Andrew Ng, this course was an exhilarating ride.
